MADHack is a mobile app development hackathon and workshop series organized by the IEEE Student Branch of UCSC. It gives university students in Sri Lanka the chance to participate in a mobile app development competition, allowing them to sharpen
their skills and learn from experts in the field. The competition aims to recognize and reward talent in mobile application development.

MADHack Agon is a 6-hour hackathon round where participants will be given a partially developed appication written in Android Native code, with tasks and functionalities to complete before the timer runs out. The top ten teams will move to the Final Hackathon.

Happy Hacking!
